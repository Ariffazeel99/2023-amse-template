# Project Plan

## Summary

This project aims to analyze the temporal patterns and changes in the vehicle inventory over time using two datasets: "Vehicle inventory M端nster district 2018-2022" and "Germany Cars Dataset." The goal is to identify significant trends, fluctuations, and patterns in the data over the years and assess if they align between the two datasets.

## Rationale

TThe analysis of temporal patterns in the vehicle inventory data can provide valuable insights into the market trends, preferences, and changes in the M端nster district and Germany as a whole. By comparing the two datasets, we can gain a comprehensive understanding of the vehicle market dynamics, identify potential discrepancies or inconsistencies, and inform decision-making processes related to automotive businesses, transportation planning, and policy-making.
